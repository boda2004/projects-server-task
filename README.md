# media-server-task

Develop a sample of a micro-services server architecture.
The server should contain two services:
1. API service - Implement CRUD api for uploading and returning of media files. 
2. Media service - responsible for the actual handling and BL for media.

For the Media handling please  you can use Cloudinary service and SDK 
https://cloudinary.com/documentation/java_integration 
If you prefer any other media/host provider like S3, you can choose whatever service you prefer and familiar with.

### Bonus 
1. Use Docker for servers.
2. Reactive programming 


### Last thing
##### What we anticipate to see in the  app:

1. Write the app with Java and Spring
2. Write unit tests
3. Use design patterns that allows flexible code structure, showing anticipation for evolution and new features 
4. Cut corners, but not to the point where the structure vanishes
5. Conventional coding style
6. README file and Reasonable comments (where needed)

# Good luck!
